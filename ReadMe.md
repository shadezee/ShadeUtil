<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A lightweight PyQt6-based desktop multi-utility application to streamline common Windows maintenance tasks.  
Includes features like driver reset, Bing wallpaper compilation, and temp file cleanup.

<br>

## Why it was built
Built out of pure frustration:
- My HID and Wi-Fi drivers kept acting up, usually at the worst times and manually resetting them was a tedious task.
- My Temp folder would *silently* fill up, adding to my list of things that *silently piss me off*. 
- Bing wallpaper service has üî•**fire**üî• content!!!

<br>
